# TeamLocustResearch
The Team Locust and Halo of trust, studying and organizing computer science, neural networks, physics and other things!  All algorithms were the product and initial design of a wide scope of mathematical layers all working together.  My name is Luke Locust, Jr.  I am looking for a job or work in this type of field.  I have a large collection of data and formalizations with proofs from my work and how it can be used to simplify and optimize systems.
