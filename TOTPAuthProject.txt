In this example, we're using the pyotp library to generate TOTP codes based on a shared secret key. The send_challenge_to_device and receive_response_from_device functions are placeholders for the actual code that sends and receives data to and from the user's device. The hmac.compare_digest function is used to securely compare the response string with the response received from the user's device.
